# FE-technical-task
technical task for Dotcrafted - front end application to create, manage, store, display a library of contacts

Before setting up the package.json file I'm going to list what I intend to use initially to create my first commit
(this list will grow as I progress through the build process)

Steps:
1. set up the package.json for the intial stages of development
2. get MongoDB set up and connected


Main Dependencies:
1. Express - web framework to handle the routing
2. BcryptJS - for hashing passwords
3. JSON Web Token - for authentication using JWTs
4. Config - for use with global variables
5. Express Validator - to validate incoming data
6. Mongoose - abstraction layer to interacting with the database

Dev Dependencies:
1. NodeMon - allows the server to have a watch set up
2. Concurrently - allows the running of front and back end servers at the same time
